&lt;p&gt;Micro-manager is a powerful framework for hardware integration, is a ideal solution for EVA project to support hardwares. Micro-manager is used to support all kinds of microscopies and accessories by providing a flexiable driver adapter machanisim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For EVA project itself, we trying to include some open source hardware in order to build less-pricy research platform. We decide to use Micro-manager as a midware to bridge the hardware and the Icy software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And another reason is, Micro-Manager is fully supported in Icy, we got "Micro-Manager for Icy" and many other plugins can work with Micro-Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Micro-Manager, all kinds of data can be represent as image. Signals in 1D can also treated as a one-row image, and the value range can be 8 bit to 64 bit, so it can represent almost every kind of signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will demostrate this framework with a ultrasonic imaging device.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="plugin"></category></entry></feed>
